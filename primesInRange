PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Find Prime numbers in a range 
Medium Accuracy: 63.56% Submissions: 13100 Points: 4
Given two integers M and N, generate all primes between M and N.
Example 1:
Input:
M=1,N=10
Output:
2 3 5 7
Explanation:
The prime numbers between 1 and 10
are 2,3,5 and 7.
Example 2:
Input:
M=2, N=5
Output:
2,3,5
Explanation:
The prime numbers between 2 and 5 are 
2,3 and 5.

Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function primeRange() which takes 2 integer inputs M and N and returns a list of all primes between M and N.


Expected Time Complexity:O(N*sqrt(N))
Expected Auxillary Space:O(1)
Constraints:
1<=M<=N<=106
 
 SOLUTION:
 
class Solution: 
    def primeRange(self,M,N):
        l=[]
        if N==0 or N==1:
            return 0
        primes=[1 for i in range(N+1)]
        primes[0]=0
        primes[1]=0
        p=2
        while(p*p<N+1):
            if primes[p]==1:
                for i in range(p*p,N+1,p):
                    primes[i]=0
            p+=1
        for i in range(M,N+1):
            if primes[i]:
                l.append(i)
        return l
